Safety Equipment Detection
This project implements a real-time safety equipment detection system using the YOLOv8 model to identify whether individuals in a video feed are wearing required safety gear (e.g., hardhats, masks, safety vests). The system consists of a Flask backend for video processing and a Next.js frontend for the user interface.
